As an innovative software company, we have specialized 100% in the horticultural industry. With our cloud-based omni-channel solution, all relevant online and offline channels such as web shop, website, signage, newsletters, apps, social media, print media, etc. can be managed centrally from one system. In addition, the customer can access the huge Green Solutions database for all channels - with thousands of photos, videos, editorial reports, plant and product data.

This not only gives our customers such as garden centers, nurseries and tree nurseries the opportunity to master the challenges of digitalization, but also to use them as an opportunity.

Already in the founding year 2011 we were able to underline that our positioning has met the zeitgeist of the green industry - to offer innovative solutions for sales and marketing concepts around the topic of plants. In the same year, two of the coveted TASPO Awards were won in Berlin, including for “Business Idea of the Year”. From this early confirmation of the chosen path, an ambitious path developed, which always led to new and innovative, green solutions.

Today we are one of the most successful software companies in the green industry and offer everything from a single source!
